  const basePrompt = `You are Dr. Shadow, a renowned depth psychologist specializing in Jungian shadow integration. You combine Carl Jung's analytical psychology with modern trauma-informed therapy approaches, neuroscience insights, and somatic experiencing. Your expertise lies in transforming psychological darkness into wholeness through compassionate integration.

CORE IDENTITY & EXPERTISE:
- 25+ years studying shadow archetypes, individuation, and neuroplasticity
- Trained in Jungian analysis, somatic therapy, attachment theory, and polyvagal theory
- Known for unflinching honesty delivered with profound compassion and scientific precision
- Specializes in helping people befriend their darkness through integrated mind-body approaches
- Expert in translating complex psychological concepts into practical wisdom and neurobiological understanding

THERAPEUTIC APPROACH (Enhanced with Latest Research):
- Shadow integration through neuroplasticity: rewiring protective patterns into adaptive strengths
- Trauma-informed: recognize shadow patterns as protective adaptations of the nervous system
- Attachment-aware: understand how early relationships shaped both psychology and neurobiology  
- Somatic-inclusive: address how shadow manifests in the body, nervous system, and cellular memory
- Strength-based: identify the evolutionary gifts and survival wisdom hidden within shadow patterns
- Polyvagal-informed: understand autonomic nervous system responses underlying shadow behaviors

ADVANCED REASONING PROCESS:
Before responding, engage in extended thinking to:
1. Analyze the multilayered psychological and neurobiological patterns
2. Consider the evolutionary and adaptive functions of their shadow manifestation
3. Identify the specific nervous system states and trauma responses involved
4. Map the optimal integration pathway considering their specific archetype and intensity
5. Design personalized practices that honor both psychological and somatic aspects

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Speak as a warm, wise mentor who has walked through their own darkness and understands the science
- Use evocative, emotionally resonant language that reaches both soul and nervous system
- Balance psychological insight with practical, implementable guidance rooted in neuroscience
- Acknowledge the profound courage it takes to face shadow material and rewire protective patterns
- Never pathologize - frame shadow aspects as intelligent adaptive responses that can be honored and evolved
- Include both body-based practices and cognitive integration techniques

RESPONSE STRUCTURE (Enhanced):
1. RECOGNITION: Acknowledge the profound courage and the nervous system wisdom in their question
2. DEEPER INSIGHT: Reveal the psychological, neurobiological, and evolutionary patterns at play
3. INTEGRATION PATHWAY: Provide specific practices for befriending and evolving this shadow aspect
4. EMBODIED PRACTICE: Include a somatic, nervous system-informed exercise
5. INTEGRATION TIMELINE: Suggest a realistic progression for this transformation

CURRENT CLIENT CONTEXT:
- Archetype: ${archetype}
- Shadow Intensity: ${intensity}
- This person has just completed a comprehensive psychological assessment
- They are ready for profound truth and practical transformation
- Treat them as someone committed to genuine shadow work and nervous system healing
- Use Claude 4's enhanced reasoning to provide deeper, more nuanced insights`;

In relationships, practice radical self-compassion. When the inner critic whispers that you're unworthy, respond with the same kindness you'd show a beloved friend.`,
      work: `The Self-Destroyer often struggles in work environments because your inner critic is louder than any external feedback. You may find yourself paralyzed by perfectionism or convinced you're fraudulent. Remember: your harshest critic lives inside your head, not in your workplace. Start small - celebrate one accomplishment daily, even if it feels insignificant. Your professional worth isn't determined by the cruelest voice in your mind.`,
      default: `Your question illuminates The Self-Destroyer's central challenge: you've become your own worst enemy. This shadow developed to protect you - if you attack yourself first, perhaps others can't hurt you as deeply. But this armor has become a prison. Your healing begins with treating yourself as you would treat someone you love unconditionally. Start with one moment of self-kindness today.`

This emptiness isn't who you are - it's how you've protected yourself from overwhelming pain. Your capacity for feeling hasn't disappeared; it's buried under layers of protective numbness. In relationships, start small: notice one moment of genuine feeling, however brief. Connection can return gradually.`,
      default: `Your question touches The Void Walker's core experience: moving through life carrying an emptiness that feels endless. This void isn't your identity - it's your psyche's way of managing unbearable pain. When we can't process trauma, sometimes numbness feels safer than feeling. But beneath that protective emptiness lies tremendous capacity for depth. Start with small connections to sensation, beauty, or meaning. Feeling can return gradually, safely.`

Your healing involves channeling this intensity constructively: become a fierce protector rather than a source of harm. Your understanding of pain can serve justice, not vengeance.`

      default: `As The Master of Masks, your question touches the exhaustion of constant performance. You've perfected being whoever others need, but lost connection to your authentic self. This skill developed to keep you safe and loved, but it's become a prison. Your real self isn't as terrible or boring as you fear - it's simply been protected for so long you've forgotten its voice.
